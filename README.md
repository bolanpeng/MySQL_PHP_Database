# Project Requirement

This is a database driven website using HTML, PHP and MySQL. HTML is a markup language used for laying out the website. 
PHP uses a MySQL database to store the information that is used to populate fields on the website. The database should 
have at least 4 entities and at least 4 relationships, one of which must be a many to many relationship. It should be 
possible to add entries to every table (although it is fine to have tables prepopulated with data) and every table
should be used in at least one select query. If you have complex SELECT queries that feature things
like NOT IN, aggregate functions then you don't need the deletes and updates.
